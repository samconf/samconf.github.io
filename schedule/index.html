The panel will follow with an opportunity to ask questions.</p>

                  <p>Hip-hop was borne out African Americans grappling with agency within America’s inequitable structure. Since, the house of hip-hop has built a dialect that helps artists deconstruct personal experience across borders and identities. This event will explore how South Asian identity comes to terms with the origins of hip hop, given anti-blackness in the subcontinent, while pushing the envelope forward for other marginalized voices. We are excited to engage Lushlife, Rajuju of Grumby, and Raja Kumari to talk about their journeys in the art through a panel discussion followed by an open-mic session. Audience members are encouraged to question and probe!</p>

                  <p>This panel will focus on recent threats to the safety and freedom of journalists in South Asia and how this compares to the environment faced by journalists in the United States (in terms of increased political polarisation, legal action, and harassment from the President and others through social media). Beyond this it is also interesting to look at how each of these regions report on events in the other and how they shape rhetoric and are able to circumvent threats faced by local reporters.</p>

                    Ali Reza Malik and Trisha Sakhuja will discuss how conflicting beauty standards from the East and West shape our body image, self-esteem, and overall performance of our public selves. As many of us have grown up in Western nations, we experience two different (and in some ways similar) ideals of beauty and outward appearances. These standards can be conflicting as well as create confusing expectations for children of immigrants who live both by conservative and modern standards. This workshop aims to explore those differences and where they may stem from as well as gain insights from artists and activists in the field.
