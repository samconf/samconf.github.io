                    Jonathan Hafetz, Soraya Deen, Darakshan Raja, and Hussein Rashid aim to unpack Islamophobia in America, through and post-election. This panel will look to the future and focus on how young Muslims and other minority groups can take social action and engage in conversations in the community, while preserving and protecting their identities. By unpacking such issues, the ultimate aim of this panel is not only to provide a course of action to unlearn Islamophobia in our communities, but also to provide a space for support, solidarity, and empowerment to all who attend.

                    Activism in the South Asian Context is a panel that aims to celebrate the work of South Asian activists around the world, and to engage in thoughtful discussion about how members of the South Asian diaspora in the United States can better support the needs of their communities overseas. With this panel, we aim to strengthen the network amongst South Asian communities, diversify avenues for youth engagement, and start a dialogue to become better educated about problems and solutions faced and implemented by South Asians around the world.

                    <u class="p3">Description:</u>
                    Ali Reza Malik and Trisha Sakhuja will discuss how conflicting beauty standards from the East and West shape our body image, self-esteem, and overall performance of our public selves. As many of us have grown up in Western nations, we experience two different (and in some ways similar) ideals of beauty and outward appearances. These standards can be conflicting as well as create confusing expectations for children of immigrants who live both by conservative and modern standards. This workshop aims to explore those differences and where they may stem from as well as gain insights from artists and activists in the field.
