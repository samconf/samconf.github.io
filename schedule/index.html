                  <p>This panel celebrates the innovation of South Asian entrepreneurs. The founders of Malai, The Traveling Spoon, Revive, and Sakhi for South Asian Women will speak about their experiences about how they transformed their ideas into successful organizations and businesses. From a Brooklyn based ice cream company whose flavors include Lemon Cardamom and Sweet Corn Saffron to a non-profit dedicated to survivors of domestic violence, the diversity of organizations featured reflects the diversity of South Asian passion itself. The panel will follow with an opportunity to ask questions.</p>

                  <u class="p3"><b>Guests: Raj Halder, <i>Lushlife</i>; Rajuju Brown, <i>Grumby</i>; Beya Likhari </b></u><br>
                  <u class="p0">Description:</u>
                  <p>Hip-hop was borne out African Americans grappling with agency within America’s inequitable structure. Since, the house of hip-hop has built a dialect that helps artists deconstruct personal experience across borders and identities. This event will explore how South Asian identity comes to terms with the origins of hip hop, given anti-blackness in the subcontinent, while pushing the envelope forward for other marginalized voices. We are excited to engage Lushlife, Rajuju of Grumby, and Beya Likhari to talk about their journeys in the art through a panel discussion followed by an open-mic session. Audience members are encouraged to question and probe!</p>

                  <p>Partition was, by some estimates, the largest mass migration in human history. This panel hopes to complicate narratives surrounding Partition and look at Partition from the margins, focusing on the experiences of women, of religious minorities, and of those voices that are often erased. Professors Shahla Hussain, Haimanti Roy, and Shumona Dasgupta will explore conceptions of nationhood and identity, legacies of trauma and violence, and the ways in which the aftermath of Partition continue to impact the subcontinent.</p>

                  <p>This panel will focus on recent threats to the safety and freedom of journalists in South Asia and how this compares to the environment faced by journalists in the United States (in terms of increased political polarisation, legal action, and harassment from the President and others through social media). Beyond this it is also interesting to look at how each of these regions report on events in the other and how they shape rhetoric and are able to circumvent threats faced by local reporters.</p>
